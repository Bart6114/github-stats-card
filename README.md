This is a GitHub Action that generated a stats badge that you can use on your GitHub [profile page](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/about-your-profile).

Why this stats badge generator you say? Because I noticed that people creating repos under organizations and receiving stars did not count towards their stars in most badge generation tools. And that's just a pity. So, in comes `github-stats-card`, a minimal but inclusive GitHub stats badge generator.

## Usage

The badge generator set up to works as a GitHub action. You can add it to the GH Actions workflow of your profile page as a step:


```yaml
  - uses: bart6114/github-stats-card
    name: github-stats-card
    with:
        username: bart6114
        gh_token_stats: ${{ env.GITHUB_TOKEN_STATS }}
        gh_token_commits: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        badge_path: assets/badge.svg
        header: "üëã hi i'm"
        about: "Loves goblins, despises gnomes.\nEnjoys candlelit custard pudding."
        commit_message: Badge generated by the treadmill bunnies.
        badge_path: "assets/badge.svg"
```

If the workflow has succesfully ran, it will create a badge under `assets/badge.svg`. That you can then include in your readme via `![ain't it a beaut](assets/badge.svg)` (see below).

![ain't it a beaut](assets/badge.svg)

`username`: your username

`gh_token_stats`: token used for fetching user stats, typically a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) (PAT) with access to your personal and organisation repos

`gh_token_commits`: [optional] if you set this to `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` it will use the github actions bot to commit the svg to the repo (if not set it will use your PAT)

`badge_path`: [optional] path of badge svg (defaults to `assets/badge.svg`)

`exclude_repos`: [optional] comma separated list of repos to exclude from stats, will do regex based matching (e.g. 'datarootsio' will match all repos in dataroots, 'datarootsio/databooks' will only match a single repo)

`exclude_repos_override`: [optional] comma separated list of repos to override from exclusion list (e.g. 'datarootsio' in exclude_repos and 'datarootsio/databooks' in exclude_repos_override will ONLY include databooks in stats)

## FAQ

- *Which repositories count towards my stargazers count?*

    Check out the logs of your action run. It will log which repositories are included after the exclude and override filters have been applied.

- *How do I refresh the badge?*
    
    You probably want to look into the `schedule` [event trigger](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule). It allows you to use a cron-based schedule that allows you to for example refresh your badge daily.
